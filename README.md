Broker_oQueue
=============


What it does
------------

This addon creates a LibDataBroker-1.1 "object" that allows you to manage oQueue from the safety and comfort of your favourite broker display.

* Left-click the object to toggle oQueue's premade finder window.
* Right-click the object to display a dropdown menu with various additional features.

Requires [oQueue](http://solidice.com/oqueue/) to work.

Requires a "broker display" addon.  Examples include [Bazooka](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka), [Chocolate Bar](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/chocolatebar) and [Titan Panel](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/titan-panel).


Configuration
-------------

Broker oQueue does not provide any configuration options.

However, most broker display addons do provide options to change what the object shows.  Please refer to the addon's download page for more information.


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language.
